You stumble upon unlikely dense asteroid field. Fortunately your shields are operational and prevent harmful collisions. Also you find some salvageable metal.

You crash upon some space rocks. Unfortunately your shields have not been repaired and are not operational. Your hull takes pounding and a lot of oxygen is lost before your crew pathes the holes.

The Beginning

It was supposed to be a wild ride, but not like this. The power levels of new hyperdrive exceeded the expected results at least ten folds, and you find youself in an unknown territory at least 15 jumps from Earth. Of course your ship is also heavily damaged, so you'll have to do some repairs and try to find your way home.

You are ambushed by pirates and take some hits. Fortunately your shield is up to task and eventually they give up pursuit. Running was heavy for your batteries, thought.

Nice planet

Unlikely as it is you come across uninhabited garden planet, and with aid of your sensors you even hit a nice lode of minerals. Eventually you still have to depart, but your stores are much better than before.

Unlikely as it is you come across uninhabited garden planet. Without adequate sensors it is hard to find a suitable place for landing, but you still manage to gather a good amount of supplies.

Derelict

A strange signal in your long range scanners reveals itself as a derelict ship. While the hull has some significant damage you assess that it has occured after abandoning the ship. There are no sign of the fate of the crew and ultimately you are unable to determine why exactly the ship was left alone. While you can't make much use for the ship itself, in cargo bay there are some valuable resources.

This system has some beautiful nebulae nearby, and while admiring it has somewhat lifted spirits of the crew there isn't much to do here.

Black Hole

You expertly recognize strage anomaly in the long range sensors as a small black hole. Luckily you are far enought to solve the problem with just a moderate change in your navigation plan.

WHOAA! That was a close one, way too close. Without sensors you just had no chance to spot the small black hole before ship started to act erratically. Only your experience and ability to act quickly and some luck that your engines didn't actually blow up when overstrained to the limit saved the ship. It pretty much burned your batteries dry.

You have been destroyed. You was already way too close when you saw the black hole. Even thought you reacted quickly, you couldn't save the ship. As soon as you heard whining of your failing batteries and screeching of the power couplings out of sync you knew that the ship was doomed. If the Black Hole didn't leach all the energy even from light, your ship could still be seen from some point of space practically frozen in time while being torn apart by tidal forces near event horizon. Game Over.
