Nice planet
<required>
Unlikely as it is you come across uninhabited garden planet, and with aid of your sensors you even hit a nice lode of minerals. Eventually you still have to depart, but your stores are much better than before.

Derelict
<required>
A strange signal in your long range scanners reveals itself as a derelict ship. While the hull has some significant damage you assess that it has occured after abandoning the ship. There are no sign of the fate of the crew and ultimately you are unable to determine why exactly the ship was left alone. While you can't make much use for the ship itself, in cargo bay there are some valuable resources.

Black Hole
<required>
You expertly recognize strage anomaly in the long range sensors as a small black hole. Luckily you are far enought to solve the problem with just a moderate change in your navigation plan.

WHOAA! That was a close one, way too close. Without sensors you just had no chance to spot the small black hole before ship started to act erratically. Only your experience and ability to act quickly and some luck that your engines didn't actually blow up when overstrained to the limit saved the ship. It pretty much burned your batteries dry.

You have been destroyed. You was already way too close when you saw the black hole. Even thought you reacted quickly, you couldn't save the ship. As soon as you heard whining of your failing batteries and screenching of the power couplings out of sync you knew that the ship was doomed. Game Over.
